This is a description of the Algorithm / logic segment used for tracking the statistics and sending out emails

Overall Steps:

1. Start the tracking process
    i. Read the stats data from disk
2. Initialize the time [TODO Is timing even possible on Pi?]
3. Check when the last run was ?
    i. If this is a sequential run, follow process A
    ii. If there was a break in the process, follow B
4. Update the stats to the accumulation data
5. Sleep for the required interval


Process A:

# This defines a regular flow, where the router is normal and the pi is normal and this is just a sequential read after a x minute sleep operation

1. For each AP that is available, get the last read time and value.
2. Subtract the values from the current
3. Add the difference value to the accumulation store.


Process B:

# This defines the process when either the Router or the Pi has been restarted.
# When this happens, either of the following things could happen:

B.A: Pi was restarted / was offline for sometime. This means we have missed some readings.
B.B: Router was restarted. This means that reported values would be refreshed / restarted.

Process B.A:

# This happens when the Pi was restarted. This could again go into couple of scenarios.
# B.A.A: The Pi Router was restarted due to some power issue. It started again but it missed some readings.
# 		 We resume based on the readings from the Router. We also track the time the router has been active.
# 		 We have to figure out the difference that needs to be added to the accumulators.
# B.A.B: Why did we say we have couple of scenarios ?

Process B.B:

# This happens when the router was restarted. Here we don't know for how long the router was offline.
# So we just get whatever we have from the router and add it the accumulator.
# We also update the last read values in the store.
